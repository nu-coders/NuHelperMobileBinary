Remember I don't drink coffee ¬Ø\\*(„ÉÑ)*/¬Ø

### 1 - Did you hack the university?

- No, I don't think there is a need to hack them

### 2 - How did you get all this information?

- All the information are publicly available on university website

### 3 - Your stack?

- for web: react, flutter
- for database: NoSQL MongoDB
- for backend: TS/JS NodeJs
- for hosting: oracle vps + cloudflare
  
### 4 - Your opinion?

- First I am not a JS fanboy. JS is not as bad as people think it's.
If you really hate it and for unknown reason you should use it I advice you to use TS. TS is JS but with potato chips.

### 5 - I can't find a version of the app for my Iphone (or any other apple device)?

- Ok. This project does not have a sponsor. Publishing the app on App Store (100$ every year) or Play Store (25$ life time) will cost money and as we all know We are student = we are broke  /_ \ (I will sell the app for 10^10^10^10 $)

### 6 - Why not to use SQL database?

- Actually we started with SQL database then we migrated to Firebase (Due to free tier limits) and now we are using MongoDB. The reason behind this migration was the original data format. We receive json documents so... storing json is easier than transforming them to other form.

### 7 - How do you send email?

- I uses zoho mail + brevo mails smtp to send mails
